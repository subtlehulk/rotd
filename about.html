                    SeaMi is a mash of Seattle and Middlesbrough. They are our respective
                        home towns, and so you will find that a lot of our craft products will encompass
                        similar themes.

                        Seattle is the home city of one half of our team - Courtney, the artist. Although Courtney hails from Kent, WA. It has been easier to tell people 
                        Seattle is home, as there is a Kent already in the UK.
                        It is home to the Seattle Seahawks, one of the best NFL teams in the US, and is home to the grunge genre of music, headed by the late and great Kurt Cobain.
                        Seattle shares many similarities to many cities of the UK, in that it is predominantyl known for its wet weather and damp, grey, and rather sad looking exterior,
                        but don't let that fool you, it is a great, and vibrant city in the PNW.

                        The other half of SeaMi - Corey - hails from the lesser known town of Middlesbrough, a once-great industrial powerhouse in the North East region of England. 
                        Middlesbrough is home to Middlesbrough Football Club, the Transporter Bridge, and other landmarks that didn't quite make it into the history books. It boasts a diverse community, 
                        and also offers one of the UK's greatest invention - the Parmo. Similar to the chicken parmesan in US/Italian dishes, the parmo is a 2000 calorie, magnificent concoction of chicken, beshamel sauce, and cheese.
                        You would be crazy not to try it, if you're ever here.
