# Roll of the Dice

RotD is a web application that will help users decide what to do with their day based on the roll of a dice.

This project will be released in 4 phases.

Phase 1:
    Static website - This is the first tieration of the project, which will all be hard coded into a static website. The user must manually refresh the page themselves either via their keyboard, or a HTML button with minimal JS needed.
    All of the prompts will be hard coded and I will change them on a weekly basis depending on feedback from users, and all future designs/themes/extensions will be tested via this version of the project before I move it to the web application.

Phase 2:
    web application V1 - The first iteration of the web application will give the user more of a dynamic web experience, with a database to hold more prompts, and provide a better user interface than just a static website. 

Phase 2.1:
    Web application V2 - This will be the most fleshed out iteration of the web application, providing the complete experience for the users. They will be able to keep track of prompts they have completed, included those that they may have refused, or forgot about. There will be a login function to hold this informtation, along with the ability to change the dice skin, pick prompt themes, and have a bit more fun than other iterations of the project.

Phase 3:
    Mobile application - A more native experience for users. Once the app is downloaded and installed, the user can disconnect from wifi and data and still be able to use the app (ngl, this was proposed in case the user is having a party in the woods with choppy to no signal, rather than just having the flexibility).
